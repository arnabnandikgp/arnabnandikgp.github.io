			<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the weekly blogpost for my GSoC 2024 project. My proposal for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/bn7U0YD4">Improving series expansions and limit computations</a> for the Sympy has been accepted for GSoC 2024. For those who don&rsquo;t know about <a href="sympy.org">Sympy</a>,Sympy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.In the coming weeks I will be using this blogpost to keep a track as well as update the community about the status of my project.</p>
